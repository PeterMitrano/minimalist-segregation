	abstract = {This paper has presented the simplest solution so far to the problem of clustering objects with a swarm of robots. The robots are memory-less and are unable to perform arithmetic computations. They are only able to detect the presence of an object or another robot in their line of sight. As they do not possess any distance information about a perceived object (nor any force sensors), they are unable to tell whether they are manipulating it. Despite these limitations, we identified a controller that is capable of consistently gathering the objects into a single cluster. Simulation results have shown that the ability of the robots to distinguish between objects and other robots is beneficial; indeed, if the robots can only perceive other robots as objects, the behavior does not scale well with increasing numbers of robots. Simulations have also shown that the controller is fairly robust with respect to sensory noise. The sensor/controller solution was implemented on a physical system of 5 e-puck robots, and favourable results have been obtained in systematic experiments with 20 objects, with 86.5\% of the objects being gathered into one cluster after 10 minutes (average across 10 trials). In the future, we intend to implement a solution of the object clustering task with robots at the sub-millimeter scale.},

Aggregation is used as a case study, where randomly-placed robots are required to meet at a common location without using environmental cues. The binary sensor used only lets a robot know whether or not there is another robot in its direct line of sight. Simulation results with both a memoryless controller (reactive) and a controller with memory (recurrent) prove that this sensor is enough to achieve error-free aggregation, as long as a sufficient sensing range is provided. The recurrent controller gave better results in simulation, and a post-evaluation with it shows that it is able to aggregate at least 1000 robots into a single cluster consistently. Simulation results also show that, with the recurrent controller, false negative noise on the sensor can speed up the aggregation process. The system has been implemented on 20 physical e-puck robots, and systematic experiments have been performed with both controllers: on average, 86-89\% of the robots aggregated into a single cluster within 10 minutes.},

Recent work studying swarm of robots that have no computational power has shown that complex behaviors such as aggregation and object clustering can be produced from extremely simple control policies and sensing capability. We extend previous work on computation-free swarm behaviors and show that it is possible to evolve simple control policies to form a perimeter around a target, rendezvous to a specific location, and perform foraging. We also demonstrate that simple manipulations of the environment can be used to control, these collective behaviors. The robustness and expressiveness of these behaviors, combined with the simple requirements for control and sensing, demonstrate the feasibility of implementing swarm behaviors at small scales or in extreme environments.},

	abstract = {Emergent collective behaviors have long interested researchers . These behaviors often result from complex interactions between many individuals following simple rules. However, knowing what collective behaviors are possible given a limited set of capabilities is difficult. Many emergent behaviors are counter-intuitive and unexpected even if the rules each agent follows are carefully constructed. While much work in swarm robotics has studied the problem of designing sets of rules and capabilities that result in a specific collective behavior, little work has examined the problem of exploring and describing the entire set of collective behaviors that can result from a limited set of capabilities. We take what we believe is the first approach to address this problem by presenting a general framework for discovering collective emergent behaviors that result from a specific capability model. Our approach uses novelty search to explore the space of possible behaviors in an objective-agnostic manner. Given this set of explored behaviors we use dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to discover a finite set of behaviors that form a taxonomy over the behavior space. We apply our methodology to a single, binary-sensor capability model. Using our approach we are able to re-discover cyclic pursuit and aggregation, as well as discover several behaviors previously unknown to be possible with only a single binary sensor: wall following, dispersal, and a milling behavior often displayed by ants and fish.},

The robots have no memory and are equipped with one binary sensor, which informs them whether or not there is another robot in their line of sight. It is proven that the sensor needs to have a sufficiently long range; otherwise aggregation cannot be guaranteed, irrespective of the controller used. The optimal controller is found by performing a grid search over the space of all possible controllers. With this controller, robots rotate on the spot when they perceive another robot, and move backwards along a circular trajectory otherwise. This controller is proven to always aggregate two simultaneously moving robots in finite time, an upper bound for which is provided. Simulations show that the controller also aggregates at least 1000 robots into a single cluster consistently. Moreover, in 30 experiments with 40 physical e-puck robots, 98.6\% of the robots aggregated into one cluster. The results obtained have profound implications for the implementation of multi-robot systems at scales where conventional approaches to sensing and information processing are no longer applicable.},

The Differential Adhesion Hypothesis states that cells naturally segregate because of differences in affinity, which lead similar cells to strongly adhere to each other. By exploring this principle, we propose a controller that can segregate a heterogeneous swarm of robots according to the characteristics of each agent, such that similar robots form homogeneous teams and dissimilar robots are segregated. We apply LaSalle's Invariance Principle to show convergence and perform simulated experiments in order to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed controller.

In this approach, swarm robots are able to self-organize themselves into complex shapes driven by the dynamics of a gene regulatory network based model. This is a distributed approach, since only local interaction is needed for each robot to make decisions during shape formation without any global controller. The target shape is represented by the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and embedded into the gene regulation model, analogous to the morphogen gradients in morphogenesis. Since the self-organization algorithm does not need a global coordinate system, the target shape can be formed anywhere within the environment based on the current distribution of the robots. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective for complex shape construction and robust to environmental changes and system failures.},

	abstract = {How morphogen gradients are formed in target tissues is a key question for understanding the mechanisms of morphological patterning. Here, we review different mechanisms of morphogen gradient formation from theoretical and experimental points of view. First, a simple, comprehensive overview of the underlying biophysical principles of several mechanisms of gradient formation is provided. We then discuss the advantages and limitations of different experimental approaches to gradient formation analysis., Morphogen concentration gradients are essential for developmental patterning. Morphogen diffusion, degradation, and endocytic transport all help to set up and maintain them.},

Perturbation theory is used to calculate the deviations from deterministic behavior in a simple reaction-diffusion model of robust gradient formation, and the results are confirmed by numerical simulation. It is shown that such deviations can disrupt robustness for sufficiently high noise levels, and the implications of these findings for more complex models of gradient-shaping pathways are discussed.},

	abstract = {Nest construction is an impressive achievement for social insects. They employ                 templates (or pat terns) in the environment to guide construction tasks and robot                 swarms can use similar mechanisms. Early work examined how a spatio-temporal varying                 template can be utilized by a swarm of minimalist robots to build the framework for                 a linear wall. From this, it became clear that a method for regulating construction                 in a variable environment was needed. To this end, a social insect inspired                 distributed feedback mechanism is proposed and verified. Direct and indirect                 transfer of information between individuals, through the use of signals and cues, is                 shown to facilitate closure of a feedback loop allowing the system to operate close                 to optimally. Perturbation experiments demonstrate the robotic swarm's                 ability to adapt to environmental changes. The work described in this paper provides                 the basis for a distributed robotic system capable of constructing any given planar                 structure—a goal implicit in many of the suggested applications for                 collective construction.},

	abstract = {Self-organization is a concept and phenomenon whereby system-level patterns spontaneously arise solely from interactions among subunits of the system. Focusing on self-organization at the organismal level, I ask the question: are the boundaries to self-organization indistinct? After reviewing a number of published definitions of self-organization, I explore the conceptual boundaries among self-organization and two similar concepts, stigmergy and self-assembly. I highlight borderline cases that may blur the distinction among these and suggest that they may indeed be conceptually indistinct and difficult to separate in practice. Consequently, I propose a classification scheme based upon three aspects: whether the stimuli to which individuals respond are quantitative or qualitative, whether positive feedback is involved, and whether interindividual interactions are direct or indirect (stigmergic). In addition, I consider several other issues about self-organization, including (1) could a self-organized system use global information? (2) what is the role of the degree of correlation of activity among individuals? and (3) what is the role of positive feedback?},

	abstract = {We present a distributed algorithm for converging autonomous mobile robots with limited visibility toward a single point. Each robot is an omnidirectional mobile processor that repeatedly: 1) observes the relative positions of those robots that are visible; 2) computes its new position based on the observation using the given algorithm; 3) moves to that position. The robots' visibility is limited so that two robots can see each other if and only if they are within distance V of each other and there are no other robots between them. Our algorithm is memoryless in the sense that the next position of a robot is determined entirely from the positions of the robots that it can see at that moment. The correctness of the algorithm is proved formally under an abstract model of the robot system in which: 1) each robot is represented by a point that does not obstruct the view of other robots; 2) the robots' motion is instantaneous; 3) there are no sensor and control error; 4) the issue of collision is ignored. The results of computer simulation under a more realistic model give convincing indication that the algorithm, if implemented on physical robots, will be robust against sensor and control error},
