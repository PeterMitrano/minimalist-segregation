	abstract = {This paper has presented the simplest solution so far to the problem of clustering objects with a swarm of robots. The robots are memory-less and are unable to perform arithmetic computations. They are only able to detect the presence of an object or another robot in their line of sight. As they do not possess any distance information about a perceived object (nor any force sensors), they are unable to tell whether they are manipulating it. Despite these limitations, we identified a controller that is capable of consistently gathering the objects into a single cluster. Simulation results have shown that the ability of the robots to distinguish between objects and other robots is beneficial; indeed, if the robots can only perceive other robots as objects, the behavior does not scale well with increasing numbers of robots. Simulations have also shown that the controller is fairly robust with respect to sensory noise. The sensor/controller solution was implemented on a physical system of 5 e-puck robots, and favourable results have been obtained in systematic experiments with 20 objects, with 86.5\% of the objects being gathered into one cluster after 10 minutes (average across 10 trials). In the future, we intend to implement a solution of the object clustering task with robots at the sub-millimeter scale.},

Aggregation is used as a case study, where randomly-placed robots are required to meet at a common location without using environmental cues. The binary sensor used only lets a robot know whether or not there is another robot in its direct line of sight. Simulation results with both a memoryless controller (reactive) and a controller with memory (recurrent) prove that this sensor is enough to achieve error-free aggregation, as long as a sufficient sensing range is provided. The recurrent controller gave better results in simulation, and a post-evaluation with it shows that it is able to aggregate at least 1000 robots into a single cluster consistently. Simulation results also show that, with the recurrent controller, false negative noise on the sensor can speed up the aggregation process. The system has been implemented on 20 physical e-puck robots, and systematic experiments have been performed with both controllers: on average, 86-89\% of the robots aggregated into a single cluster within 10 minutes.},

Recent work studying swarm of robots that have no computational power has shown that complex behaviors such as aggregation and object clustering can be produced from extremely simple control policies and sensing capability. We extend previous work on computation-free swarm behaviors and show that it is possible to evolve simple control policies to form a perimeter around a target, rendezvous to a specific location, and perform foraging. We also demonstrate that simple manipulations of the environment can be used to control, these collective behaviors. The robustness and expressiveness of these behaviors, combined with the simple requirements for control and sensing, demonstrate the feasibility of implementing swarm behaviors at small scales or in extreme environments.},

	abstract = {Emergent collective behaviors have long interested researchers . These behaviors often result from complex interactions between many individuals following simple rules. However, knowing what collective behaviors are possible given a limited set of capabilities is difficult. Many emergent behaviors are counter-intuitive and unexpected even if the rules each agent follows are carefully constructed. While much work in swarm robotics has studied the problem of designing sets of rules and capabilities that result in a specific collective behavior, little work has examined the problem of exploring and describing the entire set of collective behaviors that can result from a limited set of capabilities. We take what we believe is the first approach to address this problem by presenting a general framework for discovering collective emergent behaviors that result from a specific capability model. Our approach uses novelty search to explore the space of possible behaviors in an objective-agnostic manner. Given this set of explored behaviors we use dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to discover a finite set of behaviors that form a taxonomy over the behavior space. We apply our methodology to a single, binary-sensor capability model. Using our approach we are able to re-discover cyclic pursuit and aggregation, as well as discover several behaviors previously unknown to be possible with only a single binary sensor: wall following, dispersal, and a milling behavior often displayed by ants and fish.},

The robots have no memory and are equipped with one binary sensor, which informs them whether or not there is another robot in their line of sight. It is proven that the sensor needs to have a sufficiently long range; otherwise aggregation cannot be guaranteed, irrespective of the controller used. The optimal controller is found by performing a grid search over the space of all possible controllers. With this controller, robots rotate on the spot when they perceive another robot, and move backwards along a circular trajectory otherwise. This controller is proven to always aggregate two simultaneously moving robots in finite time, an upper bound for which is provided. Simulations show that the controller also aggregates at least 1000 robots into a single cluster consistently. Moreover, in 30 experiments with 40 physical e-puck robots, 98.6\% of the robots aggregated into one cluster. The results obtained have profound implications for the implementation of multi-robot systems at scales where conventional approaches to sensing and information processing are no longer applicable.},

The Differential Adhesion Hypothesis states that cells naturally segregate because of differences in affinity, which lead similar cells to strongly adhere to each other. By exploring this principle, we propose a controller that can segregate a heterogeneous swarm of robots according to the characteristics of each agent, such that similar robots form homogeneous teams and dissimilar robots are segregated. We apply LaSalle's Invariance Principle to show convergence and perform simulated experiments in order to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed controller.

In this approach, swarm robots are able to self-organize themselves into complex shapes driven by the dynamics of a gene regulatory network based model. This is a distributed approach, since only local interaction is needed for each robot to make decisions during shape formation without any global controller. The target shape is represented by the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and embedded into the gene regulation model, analogous to the morphogen gradients in morphogenesis. Since the self-organization algorithm does not need a global coordinate system, the target shape can be formed anywhere within the environment based on the current distribution of the robots. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective for complex shape construction and robust to environmental changes and system failures.},

They employ                 templates (or pat terns) in the environment to guide construction tasks and robot                 swarms can use similar mechanisms. Early work examined how a spatio-temporal varying                 template can be utilized by a swarm of minimalist robots to build the framework for                 a linear wall. From this, it became clear that a method for regulating construction                 in a variable environment was needed. To this end, a social insect inspired                 distributed feedback mechanism is proposed and verified. Direct and indirect                 transfer of information between individuals, through the use of signals and cues, is                 shown to facilitate closure of a feedback loop allowing the system to operate close                 to optimally. Perturbation experiments demonstrate the robotic swarm's                 ability to adapt to environmental changes. The work described in this paper provides                 the basis for a distributed robotic system capable of constructing any given planar                 structure—a goal implicit in many of the suggested applications for                 collective construction.},

	abstract = {Self-organization is a concept and phenomenon whereby system-level patterns spontaneously arise solely from interactions among subunits of the system. Focusing on self-organization at the organismal level, I ask the question: are the boundaries to self-organization indistinct? After reviewing a number of published definitions of self-organization, I explore the conceptual boundaries among self-organization and two similar concepts, stigmergy and self-assembly. I highlight borderline cases that may blur the distinction among these and suggest that they may indeed be conceptually indistinct and difficult to separate in practice. Consequently, I propose a classification scheme based upon three aspects: whether the stimuli to which individuals respond are quantitative or qualitative, whether positive feedback is involved, and whether interindividual interactions are direct or indirect (stigmergic). In addition, I consider several other issues about self-organization, including (1) could a self-organized system use global information? (2) what is the role of the degree of correlation of activity among individuals? and (3) what is the role of positive feedback?},

	abstract = {We present a distributed algorithm for converging autonomous mobile robots with limited visibility toward a single point. Each robot is an omnidirectional mobile processor that repeatedly: 1) observes the relative positions of those robots that are visible; 2) computes its new position based on the observation using the given algorithm; 3) moves to that position. The robots' visibility is limited so that two robots can see each other if and only if they are within distance V of each other and there are no other robots between them. Our algorithm is memoryless in the sense that the next position of a robot is determined entirely from the positions of the robots that it can see at that moment. The correctness of the algorithm is proved formally under an abstract model of the robot system in which: 1) each robot is represented by a point that does not obstruct the view of other robots; 2) the robots' motion is instantaneous; 3) there are no sensor and control error; 4) the issue of collision is ignored. The results of computer simulation under a more realistic model give convincing indication that the algorithm, if implemented on physical robots, will be robust against sensor and control error},

We discuss the challenges involved in controlling a swarm-bot and address the problem of synthesizing controllers for the swarm-bot using artificial evolution. Specifically, we study aggregation and coordinated motion of the swarm-bot using a physics-based simulation of the system. Experiments, using a simplified simulation model of the s-bots, show that evolution can discover simple but effective controllers for both the aggregation and the coordinated motion of the swarm-bot. Analysis of the evolved controllers shows that they have properties of scalability, that is, they continue to be effective for larger group sizes, and of generality, that is, they produce similar behaviors for configurations different from those they were originally evolved for. The portability of the evolved controllers to real s-bots is tested using a detailed simulation model which has been validated against the real s-bots in a companion paper in this same special issue.},

	abstract = {Inspired by the behavior of social insects, we tackle the problem of sorting objects with a group of robots under the control of reactive behaviors. Our control algorithm is based on earlier studies of this problem, but depends on more sensing than the minimalist solution. With the additional information and our simple behavioral rules, we demonstrate through simulation studies that our control algorithm is able to create a complete separation of objects of two different classes, and that it guarantees convergence of the sorting process, which previous algorithms could not achieve. This result is independent of the number of robots participating in the task, the initial conﬁguration of the world, and the number of objects to be sorted. We also show indirectly that sorting is not a strictly cooperative task in the sense that even a single robot is capable of performing the task, though at a reduced pace. Finally, we present a model that characterizes the growth of object clusters, which can be used to understand the dynamics of the sorting process.},

We present results using a realistic simulation which shows that a simple guidance strategy based on the size of distant clusters can dramatically accelerate the sorting process.},

Our approach to this problem is general in the sense of that it does not require any priori information of the task environment and assume any specific initial configurations. The robots have only limited access to the local environment and achieve collective sorting through simple reactive behaviors. Our sorting algorithm is able to perform the task with different system parameter settings in various task environments. We conjecture that the swarm performance is not initial configuration sensitive with our behavioral strategy for robots, and that the extent to which sorting task is completed depends only on the capabilities of the robots. This conjecture is validated through the analysis of the experimental data, and a theoretical explanation is given. We extend the previous sorting work by defining a quantitative task performance metric and proposing a model to explain the observations during the sorting process.},

Brood items are moved individually. The only model proposed to date assumes that ants engaged in brood sorting can sense both the type of element they are carrying, and the local spatial density of that type of element; the model was demonstrated in simulation using two types of objects. This paper describes a system of simple homogeneous autonomous mobile robots which are able to segregate or sort two types of physically identical objects differing only in colour, yet can sense only the colour of the object they are carrying, and have no capacity for spatial orientation or memory. This shows that this sorting problem can be solved by agents simpler than was previously supposed possible.},

One of the best examples is a system of biological cells of heterogeneous types that has the ability to self-organize into specific formations, form different types of organs and, ultimately, develop into a living organism. Previous research in this area has indicated that such segregations in biological cells and tissues are made possible because of the differences in adhesivity between various types of cells or tissues. Inspired by this differential adhesivity model, this technical note presents a decentralized approach utilizing differential artificial potential to achieve the segregation behavior in a swarm of heterogeneous robotic agents. The method is based on the proposition that agents experience different magnitudes of potential while interacting with agents of different types. Stability analysis of the system with the proposed approach in the Lyapunov sense is carried out in this technical note. Extensive simulations and analytical investigations suggest that the proposed method would lead a population of two types of agents to a segregated configuration.},

	abstract = {We study a simple algorithm inspired by the Brazil nut effect for achieving segregation in a swarm of mobile robots. The algorithm lets each robot mimic a particle of a certain size and broadcast this information locally. The motion of each particle is controlled by three reactive behaviors: random walk, taxis, and repulsion by other particles. The segregation task requires the swarm to self-organize into a spatial arrangement in which the robots are ranked by particle size (e.g., annular structures or stripes). Using a physics-based computer simulation, we study the segregation performance of swarms of 50 mobile robots. The robots represent particles of three different sizes. We first analyze the problem of how to combine the basic behaviors so as to minimize the percentage of errors in rank. We then show that the system is very robust to noise on inter-robot perception and communication. For a noise level of 50\%, the mean percentage of errors in rank is 1\%. Moreover, we investigate a simplified version of the control algorithm, which does not rely on communication. Finally, we show that the mean percentage of errors in rank decreases exponentially as the particles' size ratio increases. As the error is bounded, one can achieve 100\% error-free segregation. The reduction in error, however, comes at the expense of an increase in the required sensing/communication range.},
